* Bugs [2/2]
- [X] for very bendy fibers (low k), weird "sucking" between sphere 2 and 3 when "drop" of fiber after long swing
- [X] When fiber starts off flat in the air, when it lands, one side will bend up higher than the other, the side depends on the chain axis for some reason

* Thing to try
- replace array of particles with linked list with head of list in cell
  - will make cell struct
